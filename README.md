## Installation

I haven't finished building the app yet because I'm not satisfied with its current state. The app can now set up and share your custom activities, but it's still lacking some error handling and validation. Additionally, some UX/UI improvements are needed.

If you want to start trying the app, you can clone the repo, `cd my-acticord`, then install the necessary packages using `pnpm install`, and finally run it with `pnpm dev`.

## Motivation

There are a lot of existing apps and tools for customizing your Discord rich presence activity. However, I am developing this because I couldn't find an app with better UX/UI. Although this type of app doesn't necessarily need a better UX/UI, I want to create one for myself. That's why I'm developing this.

Later, I plan to create a plugin system that will allow our users to customize their rich presence creatively with various modes of interactivity. My long-term vision for this app is to have one app that can track their activity or feelings locally and share it with their friends in real-time creatively.

## Roadmap

The current goal for this app is to implement error handling, validation, and complete the UX/UI to release a stable version.
